1. Read the [requirements]({{ "/download" | relative_url }}) again.
  
    Please do it. Did you know that updating Geforce Experience can reset game
    video settings to "optimized profile" and silently enable Fullscreen mode?

2. Are you playing with Vulkan renderer? Update GPU drivers.

    If Awakened works for you with DirectX11 renderer,
    then problem is old Vulkan drivers for sure.

3. Delete `%appdata%\awakened-poe-trade`
  
    If needed, backup `apt-data` folder with your configuration inside.\
    *(also try to restart app without restoring the backup fisrt).*{:.text-sm}

4. **Close all applications** that you can in tray and task manager.

    Launch them later one at a time to identify **conflict**.

5. Restart Awakened PoE Trade.

    *(don't forget to quit first, otherwise launching second instance will do nothing).*
