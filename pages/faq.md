- **Is this app approved by GGG? Can I get banned for using it?**

  There are no approved apps created by community. If app complies with the [game ToS](https://www.pathofexile.com/legal/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy), does one server action per button press
  and doesn't interact with the game client itself (injecting into the process, changing the process memory aka cheats)
  it can be considered safe.

  If you get banned, the first action is to [Contact Support](https://www.pathofexile.com/support)

- **I want to `Ctrl + Scroll` stash tabs without zooming my character.**

  You can disable "Mousewheel Zoom" in PoE settings (Options -> UI -> 3-rd check mark starting from the bottom)

  Don't worry, you still can use keys

- **Will my language be supported?**

  No plans to support other languages. Why is there Russian language?
  Because:
    1 - this is the native language of developer;
    2 - helps to create cleaner abstractions in code and test it;
    3 - has the most active community, at least according to the numbers I can measure.
